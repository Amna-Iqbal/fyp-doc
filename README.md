# üèÜ StudyCircle: A Full-Stack Community Platform (Final Year Project)

This repository contains the showcase documentation for my final year project, **StudyCircle**. This is a comprehensive, full-stack web application designed and built as part of my Computer Science degree. The source code is kept private to maintain academic integrity, but this document provides a thorough overview of the project's features, architecture, and the engineering process behind it.

## üéØ Project Vision

### The Problem
University students often rely on a fragmented collection of social media groups, separate marketplace websites, and informal chats to communicate and share resources. This is inefficient, disorganized, and lacks a sense of a trusted, unified campus community.

### The Solution
StudyCircle is a one-stop digital hub designed to centralize all aspects of student community life. It provides a secure, integrated platform for academic collaboration in forums, peer-to-peer commerce in a dedicated marketplace, and a structured way to share study materials.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Functionality

The platform supports a three-tiered user hierarchy (Student, Admin, SuperAdmin) with role-based access control.

### Student-Facing Features:
*   **User Management:** Secure registration, login, and profile management.
*   **Community Forums:** Ability to create, view, and comment on forum threads.
*   **Marketplace:** Post, view, and manage listings for items to sell or buy.
*   **Resource Sharing:** Upload academic resources (notes, papers) for admin approval.
*   **Lost & Found:** A dedicated section to report and browse lost or found items.
*   **Premium Subscription:** Option to upgrade an account via PayPal for enhanced features, such as prioritized marketplace listings.

### Administrative Features:
*   **Content Moderation:** Admins can review and manage all user-generated content in forums, the marketplace, and resource sections.
*   **User Management:** A dashboard for admins to view and manage all registered user accounts.
*   **Resource Approval:** An approval workflow for all user-submitted study materials before they become public.
*   **Report Generation:** Admins can generate insightful reports on platform performance and user activity.
*   **SuperAdmin Privileges:** An exclusive role with the ability to create, manage, and revoke administrator accounts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture & Stack

The platform is implemented as a web-based system using a classic, robust technology stack suitable for rapid development and maintainability.

| Category | Technology | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend** | **PHP** | Used for all server-side logic, including business rules, database interactions, and user authentication. Chosen for its strong integration with MySQL and vast community support. |
| **Frontend** | **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap** | Standard technologies for creating a responsive, dynamic, and intuitive user interface. AJAX was used for features like live search to update page content without a full reload. |
| **Database** | **MySQL** | A reliable relational database management system used to store all user data, forum discussions, marketplace listings, and more. |
| **Deployment** | **XAMPP** | A local server environment used for development and testing. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Software Engineering & Project Management

This project was not just "coded"; it was engineered. It followed a structured development lifecycle, and the full project documentation (over 100 pages) includes the following formal artifacts:

*   **Project Feasibility Report** (Technical, Economic, Operational, etc.)
*   **Requirement Engineering** (Use Cases, "Shall" Statements, Requirements Traceability Matrix)
*   **Project Costing** (Function Point Analysis)
*   **Project Scheduling** (Critical Path Method, Gantt Charts)
*   **System Modeling** (Data Flow Diagrams, Domain Models, ERDs)
*   **Detailed Design** (Sequence Diagrams, Collaboration Diagrams, Class Diagrams)
*   **Risk Management Analysis**

This rigorous process ensured that the project was well-planned, well-documented, and successfully delivered on all its core requirements.
